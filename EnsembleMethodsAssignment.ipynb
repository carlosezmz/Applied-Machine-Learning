    "# Assignment: Ensemble Methods: DSEI210-Fall-2019: Michael Grossberg\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we are going to get comfortable combining and leveraging ML algorithms with ensemble methods. In order to get respectable results we would more certainly need to spend much more time on data normalization and cleaning than we will be able to. Also we are having you subsample the data severly (so it will run in a reasonable amount of time) which will have a strong negative effect on classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background:** Suppose you are given a collection of high-importance dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. With a high degree of certainty, you want to determine whether or not a particular lesion is malignant or benign. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Experiment with different ensemble paradigms combined with different classifiers. See if ensembles help and how. How do they effect accruacy, precision, recall, f1 and variance vs. bias.\n",

    "The path here will be to go from data and meta data to a standard matrix 'X' where the rows are observations, and the columns are features, in this case pixels. We also have a 'y' which is a boolean '0' for a benign kind of cancer and '1' for a malignant kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the extensive list of imports for the whole notbook I had. You may have some differences in your solution. There are other ways to resize and import images. If you prefer those you are free to use them but you should, at least, know how to use these libraries. It is a very good idea to keep constants that are frequently used in your data at the TOP of the file. This is starndard across software development. In particular don't hide data paths deep in your code. When you get the repo there will be a zip file for the data. Unzip that file wherever you want (usually outside your your repo) but use the path variable to point to that location (here called `DATA_PATH`). You will also\n",
    "come up with a location for `temp` data we called `PROCESSED_DATA_PATH`. This is where you save out your preprocessed images and the data for your `X` and `y`. This is important because you may find you have to kill your kernel, restart some other time and you want to save your work so you can resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div></div>\n",
    "<hr/>\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:azure;color:red\"> <em>Tip:</em> Some of the algorithms run really slow. For debugging purposes only, run the algorithms on 1/4 or 1/8 of the data. Then double it and measure the running times. Before you run the bagging algorithms you should have some idea how long it will take to run the whole algorithm. Keep that in mind when you change parameters and explore better performance. Also I have included an import for FloatProgress. Learn how to use that, particularly in the preprocessing, so you know how far you are at any time.</div>"

Keep in mind that we will build our `X` matrix of classification input from our images and our `y` classification outputs from our metadata.\n",
    "* Lets focus on the metadata first. This meta data is in JSON form so you can parse them using the python json library imported above. You can either read them in as text and then use the json library to parse and convert it to a dictionary, or read it directly in as a JSON file. For each file we will look for a sub-key with name `benign_malignant`. If that key is present and the key has the value `malignant` the corresponding target value in `y` should be 1. A small number of rows are missing this key. In that case check the `diagnosis` key. In this case if the `diagnosis` is `basal cell carcinoma` then `y` should also be 1 otherwise, for other `diagnosis` when there is no `benign_malignant` key. Finally if there is no `benign_malignant` and no `diagnosis` value, the meta-data and corresponding image, must be ignored.\n",
    "* In order to make the problem tractable you will read in an image using imread, resize the images to 25x25 pixels and store the image as a row in a matrix which will have one row for each image and 25x25x3 columns with 3 being R-G-B color channels. It is also worthwile to save out the images using imsave with a slightly different file name (like tacking on `small` before the `.jpeg`) in your `PROCESSED_DATA_PATH` directory. When you have created a matrix `X` with one row for each image for which we have a meta-data value 0 or 1 in `y`, save both `X` and `y` in the numpy file format (.npy) usin the command `np.save`. Keep in mind that we should check that this file(s) exists first before processing the images each time you run the notebook. This way you can start and stop your analysis loading from the file, if you processed the data or recomputing if you don't have them proceessed. You can manaually override the test when you need to so it will compute everyting again.\n"

    "We are now going to consider a sequence of algorithms and then ensemble versions of these algorithms. Because we will be using a number of algorithms and comparing their results you will want to write a loop. To strictly minimize copy past code and instead use template strings and set up your classifiers in an array so you can loop through. In this part you neet to use `cross_validate` from `sklearn.model_selection`. You are going to be calling this on the resampled data which has balanced classes. You should do 5-fold crossvalidation, you should make sure that it displays all the scoreing functions `scoring=['f1','accuracy','precision','recall']`, that it returns the training scores `return_train_score=True` and that you stratify using the `groups` optional argument. You are making your own reports here, where you print out the training and testing scores for each of the 4 metrics. Because `cross_validate` returns a score for each fold of the cross validataion, what you should show is the mean and the standard devation. We basically assume that the standard devation is the \"error\" in our estimate so for training accruacy you it might print `0.92 +/- 0.01` where the first number is the mean of the 5 accuracies for that classifier, and the second number is the stdev.
